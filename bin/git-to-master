DESCRIPTION

This fetches the latest changes from the server, rebases against \
the integration branch, pushes to the integration branch, then does \
housecleaning.

If there is a problem, such as a merge conflict, this tries to \
resolve it automatically (including responding appropriately to
"rerere" merges). If it can not do so in an automated way, \
if tells you the steps involved for doing so manually.

"Housecleaning" includes such things as closing any \
Pull Request that may exist for the branch, removing the (now obsolete) \
local and remote feature branches, and then "parking" on the \
special "_parking_" branch.

Work is not expected to be done on the "_parking_" branch, but any that is \
done is brought over to a newly created feature branch when you do \
"git new-fb".

It's assumed that you *never* do any work directly on "master": \
everything is done on a feature branch.  In addition to being a much \
safer and more flexible way of working in general, it is also a \
requirement to take advantage of Pull Request functionality.

By default the first server name reported by 'git remote' is used as the server/remote name. \
Since most projects only have a single remote (i.e., "origin") this works most of the time. \
But if you have multiple remotes and want to explicitly set it, use the \
'gitProcess.remoteName' configuration option.

EXAMPLE

Assuming that the current branch is called "interesting_changes" and the integration \
branch on the server is "master", typing "git to-master" will do roughly the following \
for you:
  $ git fetch -p
  $ git rebase origin/master
  $ git push origin interesting_changes:master
  # close pull request
  $ git checkout -b _parking_ origin/master
  $ git branch -d interesting_changes
  $ git push origin :interesting_changes

If you use the --interactive option, then it does an interactive rebase before the first "push".

If you use the --keep option, then the process stops after the first "push".

NOTES

* If you want to use a different integration branch other than "master",
  set the "gitProcess.integrationBranch" configuration value. (e.g.,
  "git config gitProcess.integrationBranch my-integ-branch")
